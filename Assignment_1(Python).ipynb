        "2)Versatility : Python is a general-purpose language and can be used for a wide variety of applications, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, scientific computing, and more.\n",

        "3)Large Standard Library: Python comes with an extensive standard library that provides modules and packages for various tasks. This eliminates the need to write code from scratch for many common functionalities, saving development time.\n",
